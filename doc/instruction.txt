here are a list of conventions developer should follow:

1) keep the existing dadabase naming conventions
	a) primary key name in the parent is the same as foreign key name in the child
	b) if the primary key name is not defined as id, then it should be annotated with @PersistentIdColumn
	c) each primary key name shouldnot use primitive type, but Wrapper type
2) Enitities 
	a) all collection type declared in entities have to be parameterized
